Software developer, musician, and lifelong tinkerer. I split my time between building apps for Sweetwater in Fort Wayne, IN and chasing whatever music-tech rabbit hole grabs me — pedal steel, tone experiments, retro hardware projects, or the occasional late-night software idea.

This site is where all of that lands: pedal steel explorations, gear talk, old-school computing, mobile development, and the tools and tech that keep me curious.
