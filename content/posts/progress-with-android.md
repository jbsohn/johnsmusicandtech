I have been working on the Android version of Steel Sidekick and in the process I feel I am making some real progress learning about this platform.  One thing that has been intersting to me is how similar Auto Layout on iOS and Constaint Layout on Android is. While searching for more information on how to better use Constraint Layout I stumbled upon this article:

[https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/constraintlayout-vs-auto-layout-how-do-they-compare/](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/constraintlayout-vs-auto-layout-how-do-they-compare/)

It looks like Auto Layout and Constraint Layout are both based on research documented in  " [The Cassowary linear arithmetic constraint solving algorithm](https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf)". Interesting! Anyway, at least we have a layout system very similar to each other on both platforms.
