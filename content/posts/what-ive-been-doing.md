title: "What I’ve Been Doing and Where I Go From Here"

For the past few years, I’ve been balancing a range of creative and technical interests — pedal steel guitar, app development, retro computing, and more — all while working full-time at Sweetwater in Fort Wayne, IN. I’ve been part of both the mobile and desktop teams there for over five years, helping build the tools customers use every day.

I’ve also moved the blog to a new domain: **johnsmusicandtech.com**. The name reflects what this space is really about — the intersection of sound and software, strings and code, music and machines. It's still me writing, just under a name that better fits the shape of things going forward.

Now that I’ve migrated everything to Hugo and set up a cleaner, more intentional space, I’m hoping to write more regularly. This site is dedicated to music and tech — so I’ll be sharing thoughts on pedal steel guitar, other instruments I play or admire, live shows, bands I love, and the tools and ideas behind the scenes that keep it all moving.

One thing that’s helped recently is using AI to organize ideas and overcome blank-page inertia. It doesn’t write for me, but it helps me reflect, prioritize, and get words flowing — especially with limited time in the evenings. What you’re reading is still very much me — just with a bit of editorial backup.

Thanks for reading — more soon.
