&lt;p&gt;I’ll say it upfront: the Chevy Bolt is the best car I’ve ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to go electric, I already knew the Bolt was nearing the end of its run. The 2023 model would be the last—and finding one wasn’t easy. Most dealers were out of stock, and the few that did get them sold them almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I’ve Been Doing and Where I Go From Here</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I’ve been balancing a range of creative and technical interests — pedal steel guitar, app development, retro computing, and more — all while working full-time at Sweetwater in Fort Wayne, IN. I’ve been part of both the mobile and desktop teams there for over five years, helping build the tools customers use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also moved the blog to a new domain: &lt;strong&gt;johnsmusicandtech.com&lt;/strong&gt;. The name reflects what this space is really about — the intersection of sound and software, strings and code, music and machines. It&amp;rsquo;s still me writing, just under a name that better fits the shape of things going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GFI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two historic guitars are on display in the GFI room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This belonged to Ralph Mooney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://johnsmusicandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_6196.jpeg?w=1024&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://johnsmusicandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_6195.jpeg?w=1024&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a Gene Fields guitar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://johnsmusicandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_6198.jpeg?w=1024&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://johnsmusicandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_6197.jpeg?w=1024&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene was a great innovator. It was interesting to see his work in person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in Dallas for my first Jamboree! I am halfway through Doug Jerningan&amp;rsquo;s seminar. There is a lot to take in, but it has been very informative. Doug is a great player and teacher. He has prepared an extensive course for today&amp;rsquo;s seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
