What I found says a lot about how the App Store lost its grip on trust.\nNote: This piece combines my personal experience as a developer with publicly verifiable facts. Some sections include opinion and interpretation; those are presented as commentary, not as claims of fact.\nThe Ad That Started It The ad was absurd: someone sitting in a restaurant, realizing they couldn’t pay their check — then opening a game on their phone, playing for two minutes, and bam! their PayPal balance jumps by sixty-six bucks. Problem solved.\nIt was so over the top I had to laugh. But the more I thought about it, the more I wondered: how is this even allowed? This wasn’t a back-alley website or some sketchy APK download — it was advertised as an App Store game. That’s when curiosity got the better of me.\nThe Investigation I didn’t download it — I’m not that crazy 🤪 — but I was curious how something like this slips through.\nIt’s a so-called “cash game” app available on the App Store, and if you dig in you’ll find many of these titles list no in-app purchases (IAPs). That alone is a red flag: if you can “win money” but there are no IAPs — meaning no legitimate way for players to spend or earn real money through Apple’s own payment system — then where’s the money coming from? The answer, of course, appears to be nowhere. It looks like a predatory cash-game ad — part of a growing wave of similar promotions across social platforms.\nEvery “win-cash” flow follows the same pattern: it starts with bonus cash — $10, $20, sometimes even $50 “just for signing up.” But that money often isn’t withdrawable; you can only spend it playing matches against other players. Eventually, the app starts nudging you toward a deposit so you can “unlock” higher-payout games. And here’s the trick: there’s no Apple-branded purchase screen. No Face ID confirmation, no receipt in your email, nothing that goes through Apple’s system at all. The payments often happen through a webview — basically a little in-app browser — that routes you to a third-party checkout. That’s how these companies dodge Apple’s in-app purchase disclosure rules.\nIt’s all technically legal because of the “external payment” loophole Apple had to open after the Epic Games litigation and regulatory changes. What was meant to help honest developers avoid a high commission now lets shady operators hide behind off-platform transactions. Apple doesn’t list those flows as “in-app purchases,” because technically, they aren’t.\nThen there’s the PayPal logo. The ads and checkout pages flash it everywhere, implying some kind of official partnership. That can be misleading to consumers: anyone can use PayPal as a payment processor, but the branding gives a false sense of endorsement. It’s trust-by-association — or really, trust laundering through familiar logos.\nA Slot-Style Example in the Feed Another ad I saw promoted a slot-machine-style game promising “real money,” “no scams,” and “PayPal cashouts.” The overlay claimed thousands had “already won,” and the App Store badge sat in the corner to make it look official. The small print — “No top-up necessary: free to play; skill-based rewards” — is often just legal theater designed to skirt gambling rules. The visuals scream Las Vegas, the copy screams legitimacy, and the execution suggests large-scale ad buys.\nPublic consumer-complaint boards contain dozens of reports describing similar behavior: users who say they never received promised payouts, who had funds withheld, or who experienced unauthorized charges — and yet titles like these remain live on app stores.\nEscalation Mode: From “Free Money” to Fake Millionaires Then came the follow-up creatives — same product category, upgraded claim.\nNow we weren’t just talking about small wins. Now it’s “life-changing income.”\nIt’s the same formula:\nStart with a relatable struggle (bills, rent, groceries). Introduce a “game that pays you.” Overlay fake income numbers that grow exponentially. End with an App Store link for legitimacy. The effect is deceptive familiarity. It weaponizes people’s financial anxiety with false hope — and the ad platforms (which profit from the buys) have little incentive to block the spenders.\nThe Real Problem The old argument was that Apple’s commission was too high. And yeah, many developers argued that. But here’s the irony: in the name of “fairness” and “choice,” the gates were opened, and this is what poured in. These ads exploit the App Store’s remaining aura of safety. They say “Opens App Store” instead of “Opens random website” — and that design cue is enough to lower people’s guard.\nWhen the Rules Worked Too Well I’ve actually been on the other side of this — as a developer. Apple once rejected one of my own app submissions simply because I hadn’t yet adopted a privacy policy. And to be fair, that was the right call. They were serious about protecting users back then.\nBut it didn’t stop there. I’ve worked on apps where Apple rejected builds for using certain web content — things that would have been fine anywhere else. Meanwhile, the Android version of the exact same app frequently sailed through Google Play without a hiccup. At the time, that difference felt reassuring. Apple’s strict review process used to be the reason people trusted the platform. You could disagree with their commission model, sure — but at least the apps themselves felt safe.\nThat’s what makes this new era so jarring. The same company that once rejected apps for minor compliance issues now hosts flashy “earn-money” games that make sweeping payout claims. It’s not just hypocrisy — it feels like a collapse of standards.\nThe Takeaway If Apple’s old App Store was a walled garden, the new one feels more like a carnival midway. The rules are looser, the scams are slicker, and the trust Apple spent years building is being eroded by lax ad vetting and creative legal workarounds.\nMeanwhile, legitimate developers still get flagged for privacy compliance issues. It’s kind of heartbreaking to see a platform once known for curation now hosting so much digital snake oil.\nTo be fair, the App Store still does an excellent job at what it was originally built for: keeping malware off your device. You’re unlikely to download something that hijacks your phone or steals your contacts.\n🎯 How Fake Ratings Keep These Scams Alive If you’ve ever wondered how these cash-game titles can sit at high star averages despite complaint threads, here’s how the listings stay glossy.\nThe Ratings Reset Trick — Push an update, clear old reviews, and start fresh. Paid Review Farms — Burst campaigns of fake 5-star installs and reviews. “Review Gating” — Only happy users are prompted to rate. The Bait-and-Switch — Rebrand or change an app but keep the same listing history. Bribed Reviews — Offer in-game bonuses in exchange for 5-star ratings. The Numbers Lie — A flood of short 5-star taps drowns out fewer long 1-star complaints. Why Platforms Don’t Always Intervene — Scale, automation, and unclear incentives mean technical policy violations are prioritized over deceptive marketing. These manipulations exploit the gap between policy and practice — and they’re extremely profitable even if only a tiny fraction of users ever deposit real money.\n💔 Why So Many People Believe It At first glance, it’s easy to scoff at someone believing they can earn cash instantly in a restaurant. But these campaigns are engineered to be believable. They borrow the platform’s trust signals, use comfortable UX, and prey on real financial stress. That combination is powerful.\nThe Illusion of Safety: An App Store badge and familiar icons lower the guard. Hope as a Hook: These creatives aim at people looking for relief, not just entertainment. Familiar Design: Payment logos and app store affordances create false authenticity. Diffuse Responsibility: No single company owns the problem — platforms defer, processors process, advertisers advertise. The Math of Manipulation: Even a small percentage of paying users scales quickly into sizable profit. That’s the real tragedy — not gullibility, but misplaced trust.\n🔎 Expanded Fact Check \u0026 Sources Claim / Assertion Verified Evidence / Sources Context \u0026 Caveats Apple says the App Store prevents fraud and review manipulation. Apple Newsroom (2025) Apple self-reports $9B prevented; not independently verified. App Store guidelines ban review manipulation. App Store Review Guidelines Rule exists; enforcement uneven. Apple claims to remove fraudulent reviews when discovered. Apple Support (2024) “Aggressively combats” fake reviews, but timing opaque. Federal ruling bars Apple from collecting commissions on off-App Store payments. Adapty.io (2025) Order under appeal. Apple changed U.S. App Store rules to allow external links. 9to5Mac (2025) / TechCrunch (2025) Applies only to U.S. storefront. Developers can use direct external purchase links. Apple Developer Docs (US Entitlement) Specifies icon and disclosure text. Apple previously tightened rules against scams (2021). TechCrunch (WWDC 2021) Shows earlier anti-fraud stance. Review manipulation services exist. Medium – The Dark Side of App Store Optimization (2023) Confirms active gray-market review farming. Apple states all apps are human-reviewed.

<p>But it didn’t stop there. I’ve worked on apps where Apple rejected builds for using certain web content — things that would have been fine anywhere else. Meanwhile, the Android version of the exact same app frequently sailed through Google Play without a hiccup. At the time, that difference felt <em>reassuring</em>. Apple’s strict review process used to be the reason people trusted the platform. You could disagree with their commission model, sure — but at least the apps themselves felt safe.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this new era so jarring. The same company that once rejected apps for minor compliance issues now hosts flashy “earn-money” games that make sweeping payout claims. It’s not just hypocrisy — it <em>feels</em> like a collapse of standards.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-takeaway">#</a></h2>
<p>If Apple’s old App Store was a walled garden, the new one feels more like a carnival midway. The rules are looser, the scams are slicker, and the trust Apple spent years building is being eroded by lax ad vetting and creative legal workarounds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legitimate developers still get flagged for privacy compliance issues. It’s kind of heartbreaking to see a platform once known for curation now hosting so much digital snake oil.</p>
<p>To be fair, the App Store still does an excellent job at what it was originally built for: keeping malware off your device. You’re unlikely to download something that hijacks your phone or steals your contacts.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered how these cash-game titles can sit at high star averages despite complaint threads, here’s how the listings stay glossy.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Ratings Reset Trick</strong> — Push an update, clear old reviews, and start fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Paid Review Farms</strong> — Burst campaigns of fake 5-star installs and reviews.</li>
<li><strong>“Review Gating”</strong> — Only happy users are prompted to rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Bait-and-Switch</strong> — Rebrand or change an app but keep the same listing history.</li>
<li><strong>Bribed Reviews</strong> — Offer in-game bonuses in exchange for 5-star ratings.</li>
<li><strong>The Numbers Lie</strong> — A flood of short 5-star taps drowns out fewer long 1-star complaints.</li>
<li><strong>Why Platforms Don’t Always Intervene</strong> — Scale, automation, and unclear incentives mean technical policy violations are prioritized over deceptive marketing.</li>
</ol>
<p>These manipulations exploit the gap between <em>policy</em> and <em>practice</em> — and they’re extremely profitable even if only a tiny fraction of users ever deposit real money.</p>

<h2 id="-why-so-many-people-believe-it">💔 Why So Many People Believe It<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-why-so-many-people-believe-it">#</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, it’s easy to scoff at someone believing they can earn cash instantly in a restaurant. But these campaigns are engineered to be believable. They borrow the platform’s trust signals, use comfortable UX, and prey on real financial stress. That combination is powerful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Safety:</strong> An App Store badge and familiar icons lower the guard.</li>
<li><strong>Hope as a Hook:</strong> These creatives aim at people looking for relief, not just entertainment.</li>
<li><strong>Familiar Design:</strong> Payment logos and app store affordances create false authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Diffuse Responsibility:</strong> No single company owns the problem — platforms defer, processors process, advertisers advertise.</li>
<li><strong>The Math of Manipulation:</strong> Even a small percentage of paying users scales quickly into sizable profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the real tragedy — not gullibility, but misplaced trust.</p>
