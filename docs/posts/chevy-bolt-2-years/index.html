The 2023 model would be the last—and finding one wasn’t easy. Most dealers were out of stock, and the few that did get them sold them almost immediately.\nI finally found a dealer with one in stock—the only one within 250 miles. It was at LaRiche Chevrolet in Findlay, Ohio, and my salesperson, Hunter, was great to work with. I had them hold the car while we worked out some numbers and a trade-in value. No deposit, no pressure—just a mutual understanding that I was serious.\nAnd here’s the wild part: this was post-COVID, during a time when even paying MSRP felt like a win. But I’m the son of a GM employee, so I got a small family discount—which felt like a double win in a market where most people were paying over sticker. Then I added the EV tax credit, and walked away paying around $22,500 total, not counting trade-in.\nHunter had already installed OnStar the night before—because yeah, he knew I was in. He could tell. Honestly, so could I.\nI showed up, drove it out of the garage, made one turn, and said out loud:\n“I want this car.”\nIt was actually my second time driving an EV—I had test driven a used, two-year-old Bolt a few months earlier. It was fully functional, but it didn’t have the upgrades they’d added to the 2023 model. So when I got behind the wheel of this brand-new one, it was a whole different experience.\nThe acceleration was instant—quiet, confident, and controlled. The car was smooth in a way no gas-powered vehicle had ever been. I knew it was an EV, but it didn’t feel like a compromise. It felt like the future.\nI could tell right away: this wasn’t just a new car.\nIt was the beginning of a new kind of driving.\n🧠 I Never Even Learned One-Pedal Driving I know, I know—EV purists swear by it. And the Bolt can do it. But I’ve just never felt the need. The standard regen mode works great, and the brakes feel natural enough that I’ve never really thought about changing how I drive.\nAnd that’s kind of the point. The Bolt didn’t demand a radical shift in my habits. It just worked.\nAlso—the analog touches in this car are underrated. Yes, it has a big, modern screen. But the climate controls are still real buttons. There’s a knob for the fan, physical toggles for heat, and buttons for defrost that just work. You press them, and the thing happens. Instantly. While driving.\nImagine that.\nThese kinds of details are quietly vanishing from newer EVs—and I miss them already.\n📱 CarPlay, Big Screen, No Drama One of the weird perks of buying at the end of the Bolt’s life cycle? GM hadn’t gotten weird about software yet.\nMy Bolt still has CarPlay and a big, clear center screen that doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. It’s not a rolling iPad. It’s just functional and easy to use—something that’s becoming weirdly rare in new cars.\nHonestly, it’s what makes GM’s decision to kill CarPlay in future EVs so frustrating. They got it right here. And now they’re walking away from it.\n🧪 Dipping My Toes in the EV Pool When I bought the Bolt, I wasn’t all-in on EVs yet. This was a test drive, a trial run, a way to find out if the EV lifestyle made sense for me.\nNow? I’m sold. I’ll never go back.\nIf anything, the only regret I have is not waiting a little longer. I find myself eyeing the Ultium-based Blazer EV or Equinox EV—something with more space and range. But that’s not really a complaint. It just means the Bolt did its job: it proved that EVs are better, even when they’re not perfect.\n🔌 Home Charging, Finally It took a little doing—1970s condos weren’t exactly designed with EVs in mind—but I eventually got 220V service set up in my garage. Once that was in place, everything just clicked.\nI charge once a week, usually on Thursday night, just in case I want to take off for a road trip over the weekend. And it works flawlessly: even if the battery’s nearly empty, I wake up Friday morning with 100% charge.\nOn a full charge, I get just over 260 miles of range, and I’ve found something a little surprising—taking the scenic route often uses less energy. Slower speeds, fewer sudden stops, and more coasting means better efficiency. It’s made weekend drives more relaxing and more rewarding, in every sense.\nOnce you experience that, it’s hard to go back.\n🐢 The Only Real Weakness: DC Fast Charging If I had to pick one flaw, it’s this: the Bolt isn’t exactly a sprinter when it comes to DC fast charging.\nMaxing out around 55 kW, it’s… fine. It works. But if you’re on a road trip and trying to top up quickly, it can feel a little slow compared to newer EVs that pull 150 kW or more.\nBut let’s be fair: the Bolt was already a last-generation product by the time I bought it. That doesn’t mean it was bad—in fact, it was a great deal—but it does explain the slower charging speed. It wasn’t built on GM’s new Ultium platform, and that legacy architecture has limits.\nThat said, it’s never been a dealbreaker. Most of my driving is local, and when I do take longer trips, I just plan for it. And frankly, for the price I paid and the peace of mind I’ve had? I’ll take it.\n🛠 The Heavy-Duty Maintenance Schedule (LOL) Driving an EV means saying goodbye to oil changes, timing belts, and all the other drama that comes with combustion engines. But don’t worry — the Bolt still demands something of me.\nI have to rotate my tires.\nEvery 7,500 miles.\nThat’s it. That’s the list.\nThe maintenance schedule is so light, I literally have to remind myself that the car exists mechanically.\n🚫 Never Going Back Two years in, this car didn’t just meet my expectations—it rewired them.\nI bought the Bolt as a cautious first step into the world of EVs. Now, I wish I had gone even bigger. I find myself eyeing the Ultium-based Equinox and Blazer like someone who ordered off the starter menu and now wants the chef’s special.\nBut even as a so-called “starter EV,” the Bolt punches way above its weight. It’s affordable, reliable, cheap to run, and genuinely fun to drive. It has CarPlay. It has personality. And it got me off gas for good.\nI can’t even remember the last time I pulled into a gas station.\nAnd that, honestly, might be the highest praise I can give.\n",

<h2 id="-never-going-back">🚫 Never Going Back<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-never-going-back">#</a></h2>
<p>Two years in, this car didn’t just meet my expectations—it rewired them.</p>
<p>I bought the Bolt as a cautious first step into the world of EVs. Now, I wish I had gone even bigger. I find myself eyeing the Ultium-based Equinox and Blazer like someone who ordered off the starter menu and now wants the chef’s special.</p>
<p>But even as a so-called “starter EV,” the Bolt punches way above its weight. It’s affordable, reliable, cheap to run, and genuinely fun to drive. It has CarPlay. It has personality. And it got me off gas for good.</p>
<p>I can’t even remember the last time I pulled into a gas station.<br>
And that, honestly, might be the highest praise I can give.</p>
